Using the notes from the places marked by all fifty stars, The Historians finish the chronicle, wrap it, and give it to you so you can bring it to Santa before the big sleigh launch.

Santa is already in the sleigh making the final launch preparations when you arrive. You try to hand him the chronicle, but he doesn't take it. "Ho ho ho," he laughs to himself. "That gift isn't for me - it's for you. That chronicle is a record of all the places you've been and people you've helped over the last decade. Thank you for everything." With that, Santa takes off in his sleigh to deliver the rest of this year's presents.

(Also, there's a new design up in the [Shop] if you're interested. If you don't see it, give it a few minutes.)
